# Template method
A high-level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors.
Allos us to define the skeleton of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses.

## Motivation
- Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts + specifics
- Strategy pattern does this through composition
    - High-level algorithm uses an interface 
    - Concrete implementations implement the interface
- Template method does the same thing through inheritance
    - Overall algorithm makes use of abstract member
     - Inheritors override the abstract members
     - Parent template method invoked

## Summary
- Define an algorithm at a high level
- Define constituent parts as abstract methods
- Inherit the algorithm class, providing necessary overrides
