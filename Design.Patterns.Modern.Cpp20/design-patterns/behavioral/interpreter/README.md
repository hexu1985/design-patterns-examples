# Interpreter pattern
They are everywhere.
A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).

- Textual input needs to be processed
    - Turned into OOP por example
- Some examples 
    - Programming languages compilers,
    interpreters and IDEs
    - HTML, XML and similar
    - Numeric expressions
    - Regular expressions
- Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process

## Summary
- Acts in two stages
    - Lexing: turns text into a set of tokens
    - Parsing: turns tokens into meaningful constructs
- Parsed data can then be traversed
