# Facade pattern
Exposing several components through a single interface.
Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

- Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
- Home example
    - Many subsystems (electrical, snitation),
    - Complex internal structure (floor layers)
    - End user is not exposed to internals
- Same with software
    - Many systems working to provide flexibility
    - API consumers want it to just work
