# Composite pattern
Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformly.
**A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.**

- A single object can masquerade as a collection.
- Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
- Composition lets us make compound objects 
    - E.g. a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or 
    - A grouping of shapes that consistsof several shapes
- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
    - I.e. Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs
